					Introduction
				</div>
				The goal of our project is to create a secure, online registry where a user could enter in a patient's identifier (either name or unique number) and it would generate a list of studies that the patient is involved in, or is planned to be involved in.  It would also provide a way to manage patients that are enrolled or are eligible to be enrolled in various studies.  

				<br><br>Currently the UNC Kidney Center has around 500 patients in their database, and currently encounters problems where as they do an annual assessment, they would miss or lose patients that failed to enroll in a study.  This new registry would provide easy and organization in terms of keeping studies and patients up to date and on schedule.

			<b>September 3, 2014</b> - <i>Client Meeting</i> - The clients and team talked about the kinds of people that would need to use this program, and what each kind of user would need to do.  A brief overview of some functional specifications was also gone over.  The group was also informed of a short presentation to be given on the coming Monday about the project.

			<b>August 28, 2014</b> - The team collectively decided on their roles, with Guilherme as Chief Developer, Tony Bo as Project Manager, and Stephanie Fenton as Client Manager and Editor.

			I am Dr. X, a provider. I have a busy clinic day and want to see which of my patients are enrolled in the Transition study, and what data is on file for them. I log into the Registry and type in the patient's name and date of birth. A page pops up that has the Patient's name and demographic information in front of me, and two buttons to click: "Studies" and "Surveys". I click on "Studies" to get a list and description of all the studies the patient is enrolled in. I click "Surveys" to see which specific surveys this patient has completed. I also really want to know how one of my patient did on their last Transition Scale survey. I click on that survey and can click a button "Print report" to print a report of that survey.
			<br><br>
			I am Researcher Y, a research coordinator. I want to enroll a new patient in the study. Somewhere there is a button that says "New Patient", and I get a form where I can enter in their basic information, as well as the patient's answers to the surveys I administered. I also will specify when this patient needs a follow-up, in this case it is 6 months. 5.5. months later, I am alerted (via a calendar, email or alert when I log into the Registry) that there is a patient who is due a follow-up in two weeks.
			<br><br>
			I am Researcher Z, the statistics person getting ready for data analysis. I want to see what my sample size is, so I want to see all of the patients that are in the study. Somewhere there is a button that says "Patient List" and I get to see a table that has the name of the patient, their basic information, a list of studies they are enrolled in and a list of surveys they have completed. I want to be able to download this table into an excel sheet.
