### Camila Lauren

Camila is a clinician at the UNC Kidney Center. She is very focused on her work and has a busy schedule.

She only uses computers when it's absolutely necessary, like for managing the patients on a medical program. Because of this, she has very little computer experience. Learning how to use new applications cannot be time-consuming, as time is a critical resource for her. Because of this, she gets very frustrated with unintuitive technology. 

That's why whenever I log in, I want the screen to be right where I need to be - that is, if I'm always logging in and going to the patient section, I don't want to be redirected to a home screen instead of being brought to my patients page.

She likes animals, loves her husband, and they have two toddlers together, with whom she spends all her free time with.


### Michael Kurt

Michael is a young researcher at the UNC Kidney Center. Because he uses the computer as a tool in his research projects, he is very experienced with all different kinds of application. Whenever he is stuck on new software, he consults the documentation, tutorial or FAQs.

Therefore, if he's lost at how to do something like filtering out patients for the ones he's searching for, a page that explains how he can do that would be extremely helpful. 

Having experience as a TA, he also finds it easy to guide other people navigating computer software. 

He is single, likes exercising and playing videogames in his gaming laptop.
