### Clinician

 * To log in and access patient pages
   * User logs in upon loading the website.  If the login is successful, they are brought to a page that displays their patients.
   * If login is unsuccessful, error appears and the user has another chance to log in.
   * Once logged in, user is automatically brought to patient page.  There, the user may click on the names of each patient to see the patient’s information page.
   * If the clinician wishes to view a patient who is not part of their patients, they may use a search bar present at the top of the patient page where they may type in their name, or they may click on a link that states “All Patients”, which will bring them to a page that lists all the patients that are a part of the Kidney Center, and they may search for the patient there.

 * Viewing patient pages
   * Clicking on a patient’s name will bring up their “page”.  Each patient’s page holds information specific to that patient, like their date of birth, name, and which studies and surveys they are enrolled in.  A brief history of past studies and surveys would also be displayed on their page.  A clinician will be able to edit information about the patient by clicking various “edit” buttons on the information for the patient.

 * Viewing studies and surveys
   * Not only will there be a link on the main navigation (links for patients, surveys, and studies), but if a user is looking at a patient’s page, they will be able to click on a survey and be brough to that specific survey’s page, where a list of all participating patients will be located as well as information on the survey itself.

### Research Coordinator

 * Logging in
   * Will be the same as the clinician’s log in, where after a successful log in they are brought to a page that shows their patients that they have been keeping track of with surveys

 * To add new patients
   * Clicking on the link for all patients, they can see a link at the top of the page that says “New Patient”.  Clicking on the link will generate a pop up for data about the new patient to be entered.  Once all the fields are filled in, the user will press the OK button to enter this new patient in the database.  

 * To add new surveys/studies
   * The user will click on “Surveys” or “Studies” depending on what the user would like to enter.  There will be a link that says “New Survey” or “New Study” that will be available at the top, and the user may click on it to fill in the prompted information in the pop up.

### Statistician

 * Logging in
   * Relatively the same as the logins for research coordinators and clinicians, except the user will be brought to the surveys list or the studies list.

 * These users will not be able to edit patient/survey/study information, nor make new studies or surveys or add new patients, so if they click on “New Patient” or “New Study” or “New Survey”, the pop up that appears will tell them they do not have enough privileges to add new information to the database.

 * At the bottom or the patient, survey, and study pages, there will be a link for the user to click that will provide all the information in a excel spreadsheet document.
